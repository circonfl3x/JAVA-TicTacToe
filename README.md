A simple tictactoe game made in JAVA

######**RUNNING THE PROGRAM**

you can get the prebuilt classes and run them using the command `java main`

######**COMPILING THE PROGRAM**

to compile, head into the SOURCE directory and do `javac *`. You will notice `.class` files in the directory after compilation, .class files will appear and you just have to run the `main.class` using `java main`. If you want to point it to a particular directory, you can run:
`javac Source/* -d Destination_directory`. 

NOTE: **On Windows, you might have to use `Source\*` instead of `Source/*`**
